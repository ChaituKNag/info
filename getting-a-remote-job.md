### Why get a remote job

A remote job is something that you can do as a freelancer. It is like a side hustle allowing you to gain more financial independence, allowing you to pay your loans a little faster.

These jobs may be short lived, they may be temporary and they may be part-time or full-time.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Part time vs Full time**

Part-time jobs require you to work less than 40 hours per week. Usually either 20 hours or 30 hours per week.

Full-time jobs require you to work 40 hours per week.
{% endhint %}

These jobs last typically from a few months to just over a year. If they like your work and want you to stick around, they might extend the tenure and continue with you or they may look for a new resource.
